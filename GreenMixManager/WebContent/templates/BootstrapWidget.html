					GreenMix  â€‹ a  IoT  solution  which  is  mainly  used  to  implements  a  real  time  remote  sensing 
					is infrastructure  in  the  context  of  plant  health  monitoring  and  maintenance  system.  No 
					matter  the  user  would  be  a  farmer  and  wants  to  take  care  of  his  plants or a family leaving 
					for  a  vacation  and  want  monitor  their  beautiful  flowers  inside  home.  By  means  of  this 
					system  they  are  capable  of  continuous  monitoring  over  the  period  being  away.  GreenMix 
					targets  the  temperature,  moisture  and  light data to provide information to the user to take 
					safety  and  timely  decisions  to  avoid  spoilage  of  plants.  It  analyse  the  receiving  data  of  the 
					former  states  and  the  current  condition  of  the  plant  to  make  an  accurate  observation and 
					also  a  highly-precise  prediction  reachable for later states. Such data can also allow the user 
					to  anticipate  the  health  parameters  like  reduction  in  chlorophyll  level  especially  during 
					winter  due  to  insufficient  sunlight,  prediction  of  dryness  factor  of plants.To that end, there 
					has  been  devised  a  couple  of  different  technical  aspects  from  remote  sensors  and  their 
					embedded  gateway,  Cloud  architecture  for  the  collecting  and  data  analysis  purpose,  to  a 
					user  friendly  web-based  UI  which  provides  the  user  with  some  Visualization  and 
					management facilities.
